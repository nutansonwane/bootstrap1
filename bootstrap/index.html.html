                Venice (/ˈvɛnɪs/ VEN-iss; Italian: Venezia [veˈnɛttsja] ⓘ)[3] is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. It is built on a group of 118 small islands[4] that are separated by expanses of open water and by canals; portions of the city are linked by over 400 bridges.[4][5] The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). In 2020, around 258,685 people resided in greater Venice or the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 51,000 live in the historical island city of Venice (centro storico) and the rest on the mainland (terraferma). Together with the cities of Padua and Treviso, Venice is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), which is considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total population of 2.6 million.[6]

                London (/ˈlʌndən/ ⓘ) is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of around 8.7 million.[1][note 1] It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea and has been a major settlement for two millennia.[9] The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains its medieval boundaries.[note 2][10] The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national government and parliament. Since the 19th century,[11] the name "London" also refers to the metropolis around this core, historically split among the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] which since 1965 has largely comprised Greater London,[13] which is governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority.[note 3

                Boston (US: /ˈbɔːstən/[8]) is the capital and largest city of the U.S. state of Massachusetts, and the cultural and financial center of New England in the Northeastern United States, with an area of 48.4 sq mi (125 km2)[9] and a population of 675,647 in 2020.[4] Greater Boston metropolitan statistical area is the eleventh-largest in the country.[10][11][12]

                Boston is one of the nation's oldest municipalities, founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from the Boston, Lincolnshire.[13][14] During the American Revolution, Boston was the location of several key events, including the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, the hanging of Paul Revere's lantern signal in Old North Church, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the siege of Boston. Following American independence from Great Britain, the city continued to play an important role as a port, manufacturing hub, and center for education and culture.[15][16] The city has expanded beyond the original peninsula through land reclamation and municipal annexation. It now attracts many tourists, with Faneuil Hall alone drawing more than 20 million visitors per year.[17] Boston's many firsts include the United States' first public park (Boston Common, 1634), the first public school (Boston Latin School, 1635),[18] the first subway system (Tremont Street subway, 1897),[19] and the first large public library (Boston Public Library, 1848).
